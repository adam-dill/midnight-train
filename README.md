This project was created to track when trains passed across the street from my place. A sound sensor was attached to a Raspberry Pi Zero and encloused in a weather proof container on my back patio. Once a sound is detected, it will keep track of the duration so that when the sound ends, the time and duration can be posted to a webservice and added to a database.
